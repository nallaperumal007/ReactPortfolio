App.jsx
Of course! Here are those two points explained in simpler terms:

1. **Dynamic Code Splitting**: 
 Imagine your app is like a big book.
 React.lazy lets you tear the book into smaller chapters.
 It loads only the chapters you need, not the whole book. 
This makes your app load faster when you open it because it doesn't have to carry the entire book all at once.

2. **Error Handling and Fallbacks**: Think of Suspense as a way to keep your app looking nice while it's working.
 If a part of your app is taking a bit longer to load, you can show a friendly "Loading..." message to users instead of a blank screen. 
And if something goes wrong during loading, you can show a helpful error message instead of crashing the whole app.
 It's like making sure your website always stays polite and helpful to users.
